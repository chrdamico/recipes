## Instructions

### 1. Prep the salmon
Take salmon out of packaging, pat each fillet very dry with paper towels — really press down, both sides. Let sit uncovered on a plate lined with paper towels for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. Pat dry again before glazing.

### 2. Make the vinaigrette
Whisk together lemon juice, honey, mustard, shallots, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Set aside.

### 3. Make the glaze
Mix honey, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice in a small bowl.

### 4. Bake the salmon
Preheat oven to 210-220°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper (Backpapier). Place salmon on the paper with space between fillets. Brush with the honey-mustard glaze. Bake 12-15 minutes until just cooked through — flesh should be opaque and flake easily, slightly translucent in the center is fine.

### 5. Assemble
Toss greens with half the vinaigrette. Divide onto plates. Top with beetroot wedges, walnuts, and crumbled goat cheese. Place salmon on top. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over everything. Garnish with fresh dill.

## Notes

- **Beetroot options:** Look for "gegarte Rote Bete" in the refrigerated section near salads. Jarred beetroot (Rote Beete im Glas) is usually pickled — if using, rinse well and skip vinegar in dressing. Fresh beetroot: wrap in foil with olive oil, roast at 200°C for 1 hour.
- **If dressing is too oily:** Add more lemon juice to cut through the oiliness, or a splash of water to mellow it out.
- **Transport:** Salmon can be served at room temperature. Bring components separately and assemble at destination.
