## Instructions

### 1. Prep
Soak tteok in warm water for 10 minutes if vacuum-packed. Drain.

Mix pomegranate molasses, soy sauce, and a splash of water in a small bowl.

### 2. Fry the chickpeas
Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Fry chickpeas for 5–6 minutes until golden and crispy. Push aside or remove.

### 3. Fry the tteok
Add butter, fry tteok until golden and blistered, 4–5 minutes.

### 4. Combine
Add garlic, cumin, smoked paprika, chili flakes. Stir 30 seconds. Add spring onions.

Return chickpeas, pour in sauce. Toss over high heat until sticky and glossy. Wilt greens if using.

### 5. Serve
Top with sesame seeds, herbs, flaky salt. A fried egg on top wouldn't hurt.

## Yogurt-Lemon Sauce (recommended)

A cooling drizzle to contrast the sticky-sweet stir-fry.

- 150g Greek yogurt
- 1 small clove garlic, grated or minced fine
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- ½ tsp cumin (Kreuzkümmel)
- Pinch of salt
- Drizzle of olive oil (optional)

Mix everything together. Taste and adjust lemon/salt. Let it sit for a few minutes so the garlic mellows. Serve on the side or drizzle over the finished bowl.

## Notes

- **Without sauce:** 3 stars. Good but benefits from something to cut through the sweetness.
- **With yogurt sauce:** 3.5 stars. The acid and creaminess balance it nicely.
- Add a pinch of sumac on top of the yogurt if you have it—ties in with the pomegranate.
- A little tahini (1 tsp) in the sauce makes it richer.
- If your garlic is sharp, use less or skip it in the yogurt—the lemon does most of the work.
