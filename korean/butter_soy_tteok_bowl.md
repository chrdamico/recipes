## Instructions

### 1. Prep
Soak the tteok in warm water for 10 minutes if they're stiff from the fridge. Drain.

Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and the zucchini into half-moons.

For the pak choi: separate the leaves from the white stems, then slice the stems into 2cm pieces and roughly chop the leaves — they cook at different speeds so you'll add them separately.

### 2. Make the sauce
Mix the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl: soy sauce, mirin, garlic, sesame oil.

### 3. Fry the tofu
Heat 1 tbsp butter in a large pan over medium-high. Fry the tofu until golden on a few sides, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.

### 4. Fry the tteok
Add the other tbsp of butter. Fry the tteok until they get some color and turn chewy-soft, about 4 minutes. Remove and set aside with the tofu.

### 5. Cook the vegetables
Toss in the zucchini and pak choi stems, stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the edamame and cook another minute.

### 6. Combine
Return the tofu and tteok to the pan. Pour in the sauce, toss everything together for a minute until coated and glossy.

Add the pak choi leaves, stir just until wilted (30 seconds to a minute).

### 7. Serve
Top with sesame seeds.

## Notes

- Tofu at REWE is in the refrigerated section near fresh pasta/plant-based products, often labeled "Vegane Vielfalt"
- Can substitute zucchini with broccoli, green beans, or bell pepper
- Green onions make a nice topping if you have them
