## Instructions

### 1. Make the quick garlic chili oil
Heat 3 tbsp oil in a small pan until quite hot (but not smoking). Turn off heat, immediately add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chili flakes. It should sizzle dramatically. Let it sit for 5 minutes — this creates an aromatic, spicy oil.

### 2. Prep the cucumber
Cut into julienne strips, remove the seeds.

### 3. Cook the noodles
Cook according to package directions. Save some pasta water before draining.

### 4. Make the sauce
In a large bowl, mix soy sauce, vinegar, 2 tbsp plain oil, peanut butter, sugar, and a generous amount of black pepper. Add your garlic chili oil (strain it if you want it smooth, or leave the bits in for texture).

### 5. Fry the eggs
Fry eggs until crispy-edged.

### 6. Assemble
Toss hot noodles with sauce (add a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen). Divide into bowls, top with fried egg, cold cucumber strips, sliced spring onions, and sesame seeds.
