Roasted version with caramelised edges—richer and slightly sweeter than the cold steamed original.

## Ingredients

### Eggplant
- 600g eggplant (Auberginen) – slim Asian ones or Italian work fine
- 3 tbsp neutral oil (Rapsöl or Sonnenblumenöl)
- ½ tsp salt

### Sauce
- 1½–2 tbsp Chiu Chow chili oil (stir jar first to mix oil and sediment)
- 1½ tbsp green Sichuan pepper oil (or use ground green peppercorns)
- 5 tbsp light soy sauce
- 5 tbsp balsamic vinegar (Balsamico)
- 1½ tsp sugar
- ½ tsp freshly ground green Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced

### Garnish
- 4 spring onions (Frühlingszwiebeln), finely sliced
- 1 fresh red chili, sliced into rings
- Handful of fresh coriander (Koriander), roughly chopped – optional
- Extra drizzle of chili oil

## Instructions

### 1. Preheat oven
220°C (fan 200°C).

### 2. Prep eggplant
Cut eggplant into 2-3cm chunks or into wedges lengthwise (about 1.5cm thick). Toss in a large bowl with the oil and salt until well coated.

### 3. Roast
Spread eggplant in a single layer on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Don't overcrowd – use two trays if needed. Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown and completely soft inside.

### 4. Make the sauce
While eggplant roasts, whisk together chili oil, Sichuan pepper oil, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sugar, ground green Sichuan peppercorns, and minced garlic in a bowl.

### 5. Dress while hot
Transfer hot eggplant to a serving bowl or plate. Immediately pour the sauce over and toss gently – the warm eggplant will drink up the dressing beautifully.

### 6. Garnish and serve
Top with spring onions, chili rings, fresh coriander if using, and a final drizzle of chili oil. Serve immediately while warm.

## Notes

- **Chili oil amount:** Original recipe calls for 4 tbsp regular Sichuan chili oil. Chiu Chow style is more intense—1½–2 tbsp is plenty. Even less works fine if you want it milder.
- **Crispier version:** For extra crispy edges, roast at 230°C and don't flip – just let the bottoms get properly golden.
- **The garlic:** Raw garlic in the sauce adds a punch that works brilliantly with warm eggplant. Skip if you prefer milder.
- **Serving suggestion:** Great over rice – the sauce soaks in and makes the rice addictive.
- **Compared to the cold version:** Roasting gives you richer, slightly sweet caramelised eggplant rather than the silky-soft steamed texture. The warm eggplant absorbs the sauce faster, so you don't need the 30-minute resting time.
