## Instructions

### 1. Prep the chickpeas
Smash at least half of the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher. This makes the dish creamier and thicker.

### 2. Cook the aromatics
Heat generous olive oil in a pot. Add garlic and rosemary, cook on low until garlic is golden (2-3 min).

### 3. Build the soup
Add chickpeas (smashed and whole) with all their liquid. Add broth. Optionally add passata for a redder version. Bring to simmer.

### 4. Cook the pasta
Add pasta directly to the pot. Cook until done, stirring occasionally. The starch makes it creamy.

### 5. Serve
It should be thick, between soup and pasta. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and parmesan.
