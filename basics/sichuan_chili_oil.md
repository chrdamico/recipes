# Sichuan Chili Oil (Hong You)

**Tags:** vegetarian, staple, Sichuan

---

## Simple Version (15 minutes)

### Ingredients
- 50g chili flakes (Chiliflocken — Korean gochugaru or Sichuan flakes from Asian shop)
- 1 tbsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
- 200ml neutral oil (Rapsöl or Sonnenblumenöl)
- ½ tsp salt
- Optional: 1 tbsp sesame seeds

### Method

1. **Prep the bowl:** Put chili flakes, ground Sichuan peppercorns, salt, and sesame seeds (if using) in a heatproof bowl or glass jar.

2. **Heat the oil:** Heat oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking — about 180°C. Test by dropping a single chili flake in; it should sizzle immediately but not burn.

3. **Cool slightly:** Turn off heat and let oil cool for 2-3 minutes (to about 150°C). This prevents burning.

4. **Pour and sizzle:** Carefully pour the hot oil over the chili flakes. It will sizzle and bubble — this is good! Stir once.

5. **Rest:** Let cool completely. Cover and rest for at least 24 hours — the flavour improves dramatically.

## Aromatic Version (45 minutes)

### Ingredients
- 50g chili flakes
- 1 tbsp ground Sichuan peppercorns
- 250ml neutral oil
- ½ tsp salt

### Aromatics (infuse in oil)
- 2 star anise (Sternanis)
- 1 small cinnamon stick (Zimtstange)
- 2 bay leaves (Lorbeerblätter)
- 1 tbsp whole Sichuan peppercorns
- 3 slices fresh ginger
- 2 shallots, halved (Schalotten) or 3 cloves garlic, smashed

### Method

1. **Infuse the oil:** Add all aromatics to cold oil in a saucepan. Heat over medium-low until small bubbles form around the spices (about 110-120°C). Reduce heat to low and let infuse for 30-40 minutes. The shallots/garlic should turn golden brown.

2. **Strain:** Remove all aromatics with a slotted spoon or strain through a sieve. Discard them.

3. **Prep the bowl:** Put chili flakes, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and salt in a heatproof bowl.

4. **Three-stage pour (traditional method):**
   - Reheat oil to ~180°C. Pour ⅓ over the flakes — this releases the aroma. Stir.
   - Let oil cool to ~150°C. Pour another ⅓ — this brings out the red colour. Stir.
   - Let oil cool to ~120°C. Pour the final ⅓ — this preserves the heat/spice. Stir.

5. **Rest:** Cool completely, then cover tightly and rest for 24 hours minimum.

## Notes

- **Oil choice:** Neutral oil (rapeseed, sunflower, vegetable) is standard. Sesame oil would be overpowering — save that for finishing.
- **Chili flakes matter:** Bright red Korean gochugaru or proper Sichuan chili flakes give gorgeous red colour. Dark Italian crushed red pepper tastes bitter and burnt.
- **Green Sichuan peppercorns:** These add a more citrusy, intensely numbing quality compared to red ones.
- **Storage:** Keeps 2-3 months in a sealed jar in a cool, dark place. Even longer in the fridge.
- **REWE shortcut:** If you can't find proper chili flakes, look for "Gochugaru" at a Korean shop, or grab Lee Kum Kee Chiu Chow Chili Oil from the Asian aisle as a backup.
