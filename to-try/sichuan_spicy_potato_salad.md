## Ingredients

### Potatoes
- 700-800g waxy or all-purpose potatoes (festkochend or vorwiegend festkochend)

### Sauce
- 5 tbsp chili oil (with some flakes)
- 4 tbsp light soy sauce
- 3 tbsp Chinese black vinegar (Schwarzer Reisessig)

## Instructions

### 1. Slice potatoes
Peel and slice potatoes very thin — about 2-3mm. A mandoline helps, but a sharp knife works. Put slices in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning.

### 2. Make the sauce
Whisk together chili oil, soy sauce, vinegar, Sichuan pepper oil, sugar, and sesame oil in a large bowl.

### 3. Blanch potatoes
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Drain potatoes and add to boiling water. Once it returns to a boil, watch carefully — you want them just cooked (look for a ~5mm "ring" of doneness around the edge), still slightly firm. This takes only 1-2 minutes. Do not overcook!

### 4. Dress immediately
Drain potatoes well. While still hot, add to the sauce bowl in batches, using tongs to coat each slice before transferring to a serving plate. The warm potatoes will absorb the sauce beautifully.

### 5. Finish
Pour any remaining sauce over the top. Scatter with spring onions. Serve at room temperature.
