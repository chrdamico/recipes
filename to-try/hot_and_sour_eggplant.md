- 5 tbsp Chinese black vinegar (Schwarzer Reisessig)

## Instructions

### 1. Steam the eggplant
Trim ends, cut each eggplant in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise (so you have 4 pieces per eggplant). Steam for 20 minutes until completely soft but not falling apart. Add eggplant to steamer after water boils — this keeps the skin tender.

### 2. Make the sauce
While steaming, whisk together chili oil, Sichuan pepper oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and ground green Sichuan pepper in a bowl.

### 3. Cut and dress
Let eggplant cool slightly, then cut pieces in half again lengthwise into 1-2cm wide batons. Arrange on a serving plate. Pour sauce over, making sure every piece gets some.

### 4. Garnish and rest
Top with spring onions, chili rings, and a final drizzle of chili oil. Let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes so the eggplant absorbs the sauce. This step is important!

## Notes

- **Chili oil:** See [Sichuan Chili Oil](../basics/sichuan_chili_oil.md) for homemade.
- **Green Sichuan peppercorns:** Toast them briefly in a dry pan until fragrant, then grind with a mortar and pestle. They're more intensely numbing and citrusy than red ones.
- **To make green Sichuan pepper oil:** Heat 3 tbsp neutral oil to ~150°C, pour over 1 tbsp lightly crushed green peppercorns, let steep 30 min, strain.
