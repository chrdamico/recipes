## Instructions

### 1. Roast the eggplant (25-30 min)
Preheat oven to 220°C (Umluft 200°C). Cut eggplants into 2cm cubes. Toss with olive oil, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Spread in a single layer on a lined baking sheet. Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and soft.

### 2. Bake the pita chips (10-12 min)
Cut pita into roughly 3cm squares or triangles. Toss with olive oil and sumac/za'atar. Spread on a separate baking sheet in a single layer. Bake at 200°C for 10-12 minutes until golden and crispy. Watch carefully — they burn fast.

### 3. Warm the chickpeas (10 min)
Toss drained chickpeas with olive oil, cumin, and salt. You can roast them on a corner of the eggplant tray for the last 10 minutes, or warm them in a small pot on the stove.

### 4. Make the yogurt sauce
Whisk together yogurt, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and water until smooth. Season with salt. It should be pourable but not too thin — add more water if needed.

### 5. Make the tomato sauce (optional)
In a small pan, warm olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste, pomegranate molasses, and water. Simmer 2-3 minutes until slightly thickened. Toss the roasted eggplant in this sauce.

### 6. Toast the nuts
In a dry pan or in the oven for 2-3 minutes, toast pine nuts or almonds until golden. Watch them — they burn quickly.

### 7. Assemble
Layer in a large shallow serving dish:

1. Pita chips on the bottom
2. Eggplant (with or without tomato sauce)
3. Chickpeas scattered on top
4. Pour yogurt sauce generously over everything
5. Top with toasted nuts, pomegranate seeds, and parsley
6. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil

Serve immediately — the pita should still have some crunch.
